# UDP Chat Application

This repository contains a simple UDP-based chat application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows multiple users to join a multicast chatroom, send messages, and see a list of connected users in real-time.

## Features

- **Multicast Chatroom**: Uses UDP and Multicast for communication, allowing multiple users to connect and chat simultaneously.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Java Swing, featuring a chat area, message input field, and a list of active users.
- **Real-time Updates**: Shows messages from other users in real-time and updates the user list as people join or leave the chat.
- **Disconnect Button**: Allows users to safely disconnect from the chat, removing their name from the list of active users.
- **Dynamic User List**: Shows the list of currently connected users and updates automatically when someone joins or leaves.

## Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or later

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aalexanderfc/UDP_chat.git
   cd UDP_chat
   ```
2. Compile and run the ChatClient Java class:
```bash
javac ChatClient.java
java ChatClient
```

3. Enter your username when prompted, and you'll join the chatroom.

## Usage

**Sending Messages:** Type a message in the input field at the bottom and press Enter to send it to all connected users.
**Disconnecting:** Click the "Koppla ner" button to disconnect from the chat, which removes you from the user list.

## How It Works

The application uses UDP multicast to allow multiple users to send and receive messages within a chatroom. The UserListManager class handles the user list, ensuring that the GUI shows the current list of connected users. Each userâ€™s message is broadcasted to all others in the chatroom, including join and leave notifications.

## Limitations

This application assumes all users are cooperative and well-behaved (no handling for inappropriate behavior).
Username uniqueness is not enforced, so users can join with duplicate usernames.
